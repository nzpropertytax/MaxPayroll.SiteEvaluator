## ?? Overview

The **Site Evaluation Wizard** guides you through a comprehensive property due diligence process, gathering data from multiple authoritative New Zealand sources to produce a professional engineering report.

### Who Is This For?

| User | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Civil Engineers** | Pre-purchase assessments, subdivision feasibility |
| **Geotechnical Engineers** | Site investigation planning, foundation recommendations |
| **Property Developers** | Development feasibility, resource consent preparation |
| **Valuers** | Risk assessment, property valuation support |
| **Real Estate Professionals** | Due diligence, disclosure reports |
| **Homebuyers** | Understanding property constraints and risks |

---

## ?? Quick Start

### Starting a New Evaluation

1. Navigate to **Site Evaluator** ? **New Evaluation**
2. Enter the property address
3. Follow the 8-step wizard
4. Generate and download your report

### Typical Workflow Time

| Property Type | Typical Duration |
|---------------|------------------|
| Residential (existing) | 5-10 minutes |
| Residential (new build) | 10-15 minutes |
| Commercial/Industrial | 15-20 minutes |
| Rural/Complex sites | 20-30 minutes |

---

## ?? Step 1: Address Entry

### What You'll Do

Enter the property location using one of three methods:

| Method | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Address Search** | Most properties | `123 Main Street, Christchurch` |
| **Title Reference** | Subdivisions, bare land | `CB123/456` |
| **Coordinates** | Remote sites, undeveloped land | `-43.532, 172.636` |

### Address Search Tips

- Start typing and wait for autocomplete suggestions
- Select from the dropdown for best accuracy
- Include suburb/city for better matching

### Intended Use Selection

Tell us what you plan to do with the property:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Residential** | Single dwelling, townhouses, apartments |
| **Commercial** | Retail, office, hospitality |
| **Industrial** | Warehouse, manufacturing, logistics |
| **Mixed Use** | Retail with apartments above |
| **Rural** | Dairy farm, vineyard, lifestyle block |

### Why Intended Use Matters

Your intended use helps us:
- ? Check zoning compatibility
- ? Highlight relevant planning rules
- ? Prioritize hazard assessments
- ? Flag potential development constraints

### Development Details (Optional)

For new developments, provide:
- **Proposed Height** — For checking against height limits
- **Site Coverage** — Building footprint as percentage of site
- **Number of Units** — For residential density checks
- **Gross Floor Area** — For commercial/industrial projects

---

## ?? Step 2: Property Match

### What You'll See

After searching, you may see:

1. **Existing Evaluations** — Previous evaluations for this address
2. **LINZ Property Matches** — Official property records

### Choosing an Option

| Option | When to Choose |
|--------|----------------|
| **Use Existing** | Recent evaluation exists, data is still current |
| **Create New** | Need fresh data, previous evaluation is outdated |
| **Select Different Property** | Address matched multiple properties |

### Match Confidence

Each LINZ match shows a confidence score:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ?? 90-100% | Exact match |
| ?? 70-89% | Likely match, verify address |
| ?? <70% | Partial match, check carefully |

---

## ??? Step 3: Zoning & Planning

### Data Retrieved

| Data | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Zone** | Council District Plan | Permitted activities |
| **Built Form Standards** | Council GIS | Height, setbacks, coverage limits |
| **Overlays** | Council GIS | Special restrictions/requirements |
| **Activity Status** | District Plan | Permitted vs consent required |

### Key Terms Explained

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Permitted** | No consent needed if rules met |
| **Controlled** | Consent needed, approval likely |
| **Restricted Discretionary** | Consent needed, council has discretion |
| **Discretionary** | Full assessment, outcome uncertain |
| **Non-Complying** | Difficult to consent, special circumstances needed |
| **Prohibited** | Cannot be approved |

### What to Look For

? **Green Flags:**
- Your intended use is "Permitted"
- Building fits within height limits
- Adequate setbacks available

?? **Warning Signs:**
- Your use is "Discretionary" or "Non-Complying"
- Multiple overlays apply
- Heritage or character area overlays

---

## ?? Step 4: Natural Hazards

### Hazard Categories

| Hazard | What It Means | Impact |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Flood Zone** | Property is in flood-prone area | Floor levels, insurance, building design |
| **Liquefaction** | Soil may liquefy in earthquake | Foundation design, geotechnical investigation |
| **Seismic** | Earthquake ground shaking | Structural design requirements |
| **Contamination** | Possible soil/groundwater contamination | Site investigation, remediation |

### Risk Levels

| Level | Meaning | Typical Action |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| ?? **Low/None** | Minimal concern | Standard construction |
| ?? **Medium** | Some considerations | Additional design requirements |
| ?? **High** | Significant concern | Specialist assessment required |

### Flood Zones

| Zone | Description | Requirements |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **FMO** | Flood Management Overlay | Floor level rules apply |
| **HFHA** | High Flood Hazard Area | Restricted building, strict rules |
| **FPA** | Fixed Floor Level Area | Minimum floor levels specified |

### Liquefaction Categories

| Category | Description | Foundation Implications |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **None** | No liquefaction risk | Standard foundations |
| **TC1** | Low/no risk | Standard foundations |
| **TC2** | Moderate risk | Enhanced foundations likely |
| **TC3** | High risk | Geotechnical assessment required |
