# ENGINEERING SITE ASSESSMENT REPORT

**Project:** Proposed Multi-Unit Residential Development (Block of Flats)  
**Site Address:** Riccarton, Christchurch  
**Client:** *[Insert Client Name]*  
**Prepared by:** *[Engineering Consultancy Name]*  
**Prepared for:** Preliminary Design / Feasibility  
**Date:** *[Insert Date]*  
**Prepared by:** Chartered Professional Engineer (CPEng) – *[Name]*  

---

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This report presents a preliminary engineering assessment for the proposed construction of a multi-unit residential building located in Riccarton, Christchurch. The purpose of this assessment is to identify key engineering considerations relating to geotechnical conditions, natural hazards, structural requirements, servicing, and compliance with the Christchurch District Plan and the New Zealand Building Code.

This report is based on a desktop review only. A full geotechnical investigation and detailed structural design will be required prior to lodging a building consent application.

---

## 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed development consists of:

- A multi-storey block of residential flats (2–4 levels anticipated)  
- Associated parking, access, and landscaping  
- On-site stormwater management  
- Connection to existing CCC wastewater and water supply networks  

The site is currently occupied by *[existing dwelling / vacant land]* and is zoned **Residential Medium Density** under the Christchurch District Plan.

---

| Christchurch City Council (CCC) Property File | Zoning, overlays, building history |
| Land Information Memorandum (LIM) | Hazards, consents, compliance |
| Canterbury Maps hazard layers | Liquefaction, flooding, fault lines |
| Canterbury Geotechnical Database (CGD) | Nearby boreholes, CPTs |
| LINZ cadastral and aerial imagery | Boundaries, site context |
| Nearby borehole logs and CPT data | Ground conditions |

---

## 4.0 SITE DESCRIPTION

### 4.1 Location & Legal Description

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Address | *[Insert]* |
| Legal Description | *[Insert]* |
| Zoning | Residential Medium Density (RMD) |
| Site Area | *[Insert m²]* |
| Territorial Authority | Christchurch City Council |

### 4.2 Topography

The site is generally flat with minimal slope. No significant retaining structures are present.

### 4.3 Existing Services

| Service | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Water supply | Available at street frontage |
| Wastewater | Reticulated network available |
| Stormwater | CCC network available; on-site attenuation likely required |
| Power | Available |
| Fibre | Available |

---

## 5.0 GEOTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT (PRELIMINARY)

### 5.1 Ground Conditions

Based on CGD data and nearby investigations, the expected soil profile comprises:

| Depth | Soil Type |
|-------|-----------|
| 0–1.5m | Silty sands and gravels |
| 1.5–5m | Variable sands with occasional peat lenses |
| 5m+ | Dense gravels |

**Groundwater:** Anticipated at 1.0–2.0 m depth

### 5.2 Seismic Considerations

Christchurch is located in a high seismicity region. The site is within an area identified as having **moderate to high liquefaction susceptibility**.

Design must comply with:

- NZS 1170.5 (Earthquake Actions)  
- B1/VM1 and B1/AS1  
- MBIE guidance for liquefaction-prone ground  

**Seismic Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Zone Factor (Z) | 0.30 |
| Site Subsoil Class | D (assumed) |
| Near-fault factor | 1.0 |

### 5.3 Geotechnical Risks

| Risk | Assessment | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Liquefaction | Moderate–High | Based on CGD mapping |
| Lateral Spread | Low | Distance from waterways |
| Settlement | Possible | Under seismic loading |
| Bearing Capacity | Moderate | To be confirmed |

?? **A full geotechnical investigation (CPTs + boreholes) is required.**

---

## 6.0 PRELIMINARY FOUNDATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the expected ground conditions, the following foundation systems may be suitable:

| Foundation Type | Suitability | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Engineered raft slab | ? Suitable | With enhanced stiffness |
| Deepened edge beams | ? Suitable | For liquefaction mitigation |
| Screw piles | ? Suitable | Where liquefaction risk is significant |
| Driven timber piles | ? Suitable | Traditional approach |
| Ground improvement | ?? May be required | Gravel rafts, compaction |

Final foundation design will depend on geotechnical test results.

---

## 7.0 STORMWATER & WASTEWATER SERVICING

### 7.1 Stormwater

Due to high groundwater and limited soakage capacity in Riccarton, stormwater disposal will likely require:

- On-site detention tank  
- Controlled discharge to CCC network  
- Compliance with CCC Waterways, Wetlands and Drainage Guide  

**Design Rainfall (HIRDS v4):**

| Return Period | 10-min (mm) | 60-min (mm) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 10-year ARI | 14.5 | 36.8 |
| 50-year ARI | 21.2 | 52.6 |
| 100-year ARI | 24.8 | 60.5 |

*Climate change factor of 1.16 (RCP 6.0, 2090) should be applied.*

### 7.2 Wastewater

The site is serviced by CCC wastewater infrastructure. Capacity confirmation must be obtained via a CCC Infrastructure Request.

---

## 8.0 ACCESS, PARKING & EARTHWORKS

### 8.1 Access

Vehicle access must comply with:

- Christchurch District Plan transport rules  
- AS/NZS 2890.1 (Off-street Parking)  

### 8.2 Parking

RMD zoning typically requires:

| Unit Type | Parking Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1-bedroom | 1 space per unit |
| 2-bedroom | 1 space per unit |
| 3+ bedroom | 1.5 spaces per unit |
| Visitor | 1 per 5 units |

*Requirements may be reduced if within 400m of public transport.*

### 8.3 Earthworks

Earthworks are expected to be minor (<300 mm cut/fill). A Construction Traffic Management Plan may be required.

---

## 9.0 STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS

The building structure will be designed in accordance with:

| Standard | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| NZS 3604:2011 | If within scope (?3 levels, specific wind zones) |
| NZS 1170.0 | General structural design |
| NZS 1170.5 | Earthquake actions |
| NZS 3101 | Concrete structures |
| NZS 3404 | Steel structures |

**Wind Zone:** Medium–High (based on NIWA data)

---

## 10.0 NATURAL HAZARDS

A review of hazard maps indicates:

| Hazard | Status | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Liquefaction | Moderate–High | Canterbury Maps |
| Flooding | Low–Moderate | CCC flood maps |
| Tsunami | Negligible | GNS Science |
| Land Instability | Low | Canterbury Maps |
| Active Faults | >20km | GNS Active Faults Database |
| Contamination | Possible | Historic fill (HAIL) |

Further investigation may be required depending on council feedback.

---

## 11.0 COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The proposed development can meet the requirements of:

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Building Act 2004 | ? Achievable |
| Building Code B1 (Structure) | ? Subject to geotech |
| Building Code B2 (Durability) | ? Achievable |
| Building Code E1 (Surface Water) | ? With detention |
| Building Code E2 (External Moisture) | ? Achievable |
| Christchurch District Plan | ?? Design compliance required |
| CCC Engineering Standards | ? Achievable |

### Additional Work Required:

- [ ] Full geotechnical investigation  
- [ ] Detailed structural design  
- [ ] Stormwater management plan  
- [ ] Topographical survey  
- [ ] Resource consent (if triggered by height, density, or parking rules)  

---

## 12.0 CONCLUSIONS

The site is considered **suitable for the proposed block of flats**, subject to:

1. Completion of geotechnical testing  
2. Appropriate foundation design to mitigate liquefaction  
3. Adequate stormwater management  
4. Compliance with District Plan and Building Code requirements  

---

## 13.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

| # | Recommendation | Priority |

| 1 | Commission a full geotechnical investigation (CPTs + boreholes) | High |
| 2 | Undertake a topographical survey | High |
| 3 | Prepare a stormwater management plan | High |
| 4 | Confirm wastewater capacity with CCC | Medium |
| 5 | Proceed with preliminary structural design | Medium |
| 6 | Confirm whether resource consent is required | Medium |
